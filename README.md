# Database-and-analytics-programming
The Project contains different Python Notebook files as shown below:

1. x19229887_Dataset1_DAP.ipynb
2. x19229887_dataset2_dap.ipynb
3. Joined_Datasets_Model_Buildup_Visulaization.ipynb
4. Master_Python_Notebook.ipynb
The 3rd and 4th Notebook files are “x19229887_Dataset1_DAP.ipynb” and “x19229887_dataset2_dap.ipynb” which conatined seprate datasets on which analysis has been performed individually.

In the both file API is being called for fetching the data.
Used MongoDb Atlas has been used and Codes are reproducible and for security purpose we have configuration file so that username and password are not accesible to outsiders.
PostgreSQL has been hosted on Microsoft Azure and for security purpose we have used Configuration file where parameters are passed so that username and password are not accessible to outsiders.
We have to import both of these files before running the python notebook files.

Joined_Datasets_Model_Buildup_Visulaization.ipynb contains the Team co-ordination task of joining different tables to get a final table and thus applying a model as well as visualizing the same.

Finally the Master_Python_Notebook.ipynb contains the code to execute the entire code suite, thus hassling away to execute the files to be run individually.
